		<h3>About Me</h3>
		<div id="flowingintro">
		<p class="attentiongrab">Welcome to my website! This entire site was built my me, Zach Carroll. The sole purpose of creating this was to learn how to create my own websites 
                    so I can pursue a career in web development. I currently work as a Quality Assurance Analyst at <a href="http://www.paycomonline.com/">
                    Paycom</a>. I test our internal client relationship management software to ensure it is of a good quality before being released. In addition to web development, 
                    I enjoy programming VBA macros for excel. You can see some examples of these under the <a href="VBA.php">VBA/Excel Projects</a> link. I've always been a numbers 
                    person. I am exceptional at analyzing, spotting patterns, and love working with data. This has led to success in my previous job in banking operations and my current job 
                    as a software tester. At the bank, I was able to teach myself to use their built in query system, business intelligence software, and <a href="http://www.enablesoft.com/">
                    Foxtrot</a> process automation software. I also used VBA extensively to create financial and other reports in Excel. Since starting at 
                    <a href="http://www.paycomonline.com/">Paycom</a>, I have taught myself SQL, HTML, CSS, and a bit of Javascript and PHP.  
                </p>
                <p class="attentiongrab">But that is enough about work. I grew up in Mustang Oklahoma, a mediocre town south west of Oklahoma City. After graduating from High School, I moved 
                    to the wonderful little town of Stillwater, Oklahoma where I attended Oklahoma State University. Go Pokes! I wasn't really sure what I wanted to do for the first two years or 
                    so of my college career. I debated electrical engineering, computer science, statistics, and everything else before finally settling on finance. Music is very important to me. 
                    I started playing trumpet in 6th grade and played all the way through college. I marched in the <a href="http://cmb.okstate.edu/">CMB</a> for 3 years and played in the spirit 
                    band at OSU for 5 years. Band was a blast in college. We got to go on road games and bowl trips with the football team. The school paid for the hotel, food, and entire trip. 
                    In spirit band, we got to go to the Big 12 tournament and March Madness tournament when we made it for both men's and women's basketball. I worked part-time at Which Wich while 
                    living on campus. After four years of school I received a bachelors degree in finance in May of 2012. I pursued an accounting degree for a year after that while working full time
                    hours at Jimmy Johns and eventually becoming a supervisor. Eventually I decided not to finish the accounting degre when I realized I wanted to pursue a different career path. I then 
                    moved to Yukon and lived with my dad for about 9 months. I worked with him for a couple of months before finding my job at the bank as an operational support specialist. In this 
                    role I handled everything from user security to monitoring and placing service calls on ATMs to creating the budget for my department to creating and automating tasks
                    such as reports to repairing broken validators to testing the banking software for accuracy. In addition to that, I handled between 20 and 40 phone calls a day from employees 
                    at bank branches and assisted them with any problems they may have encountered. The most complex process I created at the bank was the allocation of our department's monthly 
                    revenue and expenses. I was able to take a very manual process that would normally take 8 or more hours and automate it using VBA and Foxtrot to do it in less than an hour. 
                    After two and a half years at the bank I decided to look for a career in something different with more growth opportunity. I then found the job at 
                    <a href="http://www.paycomonline.com/">Paycom</a> and have been there since August of 2016 as a software tester. I am currently teaching myself web development and hope to move
                    into a developer position eventually. I like to explore nature in my free time. Whether it be camping, hiking, disc golfing, or going on a road trip I just like to get out and 
                    see what planet Earth has to offer in my free time.
